# BitBar-WorldCup

Small script to show current/daily World Cup information in your [BitBar](https://getbitbar.com).

## Requirements

Needs Steve Edson's fantastic [bitbar-php](https://github.com/SteveEdson/bitbar-php). Follow the instructions on that project's page to install it using composer.

That's the only dependency, and Steve's script has no dependencies, other than composer in your php installation.
